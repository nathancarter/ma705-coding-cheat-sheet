# MA705 Data Science, Coding Cheat Sheet

My Data Science graduate course at Bentley University, MA705,
covers Python and many of its relevant tools for Data Science.
[The course description is online here.](https://catalog.bentley.edu/graduate/graduate-courses/ma/)

This repository contains a PDF that is often referred to as a "cheat sheet,"
meaning a quick reference handout, for all of the coding-related content of
the course.
 * [View or download the PDF here.](MA705-cheat-sheet.pdf)
 * [View the LaTeX source code here.](MA705-cheat-sheet.tex)

Most of the content students learn by using
[DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com) outside of class,
a resource I recommend to others.

Of course, the students learn much more than just the code in that PDF,
including higher-level concepts such as clear communication of results,
issues surrounding data provenance, good visualization techniques, and
much more.  But this repository contains just the cheat sheet for the
coding aspects of the course.
